# Network Attack Toolskit

These attacks are strickly meant for educational purposes and are meant to demostrate the vulnerability in local networks.

## Ipv4 Attacks

- Arp poison
- DHCP exhaust

## Ipv6 Attacks

- SLAAC spoof
- NS spoof

### Arp poison

- Example usage: â”€$ sudo python3 arp.py -t target_ip -g 192.168.1.1 -i eth0
- Functionality:
  - Sends arp request to the target to mimic the router essientially causing a denial of service
    - Router would normally advertise: MAC for router_ip is router_mac
    - Here the attacker is saying: MAC for router_ip is attacker_mac
  - Enables ipv4 forwarding
  - Captures the packets and the target has no idea
- Concern
  - In local netowrks this attack can be very effective due to the lack of security controls and the lack of arp authentication
- Solutions
  - Static arp entries
    - This would ensure that any malicous arp request would be ignored thus defend the attack
    - But can cost overhead of having to statically allocate these entries and reduces dynamic networking.
  - IDS/arpwatch/arpalert
    - These are tools used to detect arp poisons specfically
  - Implementing PKI
    - Can be used as a form of auth within the network to ignore any unverified requests
  - VLAN/isolation
    - while this doesnt directly address Arp attacks this defintelty mitigates the damage by restricting communication.
