*************pa2 Graph**************
- This program takes in 2 arguement input_file output_file 
- Then based in the input will perform BFS on any value within the range n(Should be the first Value in file)
- Once BFS is completed this program will return the shortest path from Source(s) to Destination(u)
- The File will be Formatted in 2 parts
***************************************
Input File:

7
1 4
1 5
4 5
2 3
2 6
3 7
6 7
0 0
2 7
3 6
1 7
0 0

***************************************
- In this case 7 will be the order of the graph
- The 1st part of the input_file will be read and addEdge to all pairs until 0 0
- The 2nd part of the input_file will find the shortest path between 2 and 7, 3 and 6, 1 and 7, 
- Files include Graph.h Graph.c List.c List.h Makefile FindPath.c GraphTest.c
- sometimes INF and NIL need to be defined in the Test harness, NIL = 0 and INF = -1
