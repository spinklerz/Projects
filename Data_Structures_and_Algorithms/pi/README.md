To format C files in clang use the command "make format".

When using this program make sure you are working in the same directory as these files. 
1.) type "make format" to format c files in Clang
2.) type "make" to build these files
3.) then type in ./mathlib-test -h for a list of commands
4.) you can type in multiple space commands like ./mathlib-test -b -m which will output both commands
ERRORS:
 Clang format failed in git;

 this link was very helpful in making my MakeFile I used the same format as well as this command that automatically complies c files, format, and cleaning the files.
