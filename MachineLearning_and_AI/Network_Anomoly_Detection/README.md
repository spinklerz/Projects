# Network Anomoly Detector

This project involves building a Anomalous Detection system using an autoencoder based on my own zeek data I generated over the course of about 2 weeks.

## Techniques Used

- Data processing
- Data Visualization
- Data Analysis
- Model Building

## Tools Used

- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib.pyplot
- tensorflow with keras
- sklearn train_test_split
- python

## 1.) Data Extraction

- The Data set was imported locally
- Initially: 592337 x 22 columns

## 2.) EDA

- Peformed operations:
  - info(), describe(), value_counts()
  - isnull().sum
  - histogram analysis

### Conclusions

- Our histograms are one contigous block, given that network data can be very dynamic and unique I would say this is expected behavior.

### 3.) Data Processing

-
